    <h2>Mission:</h2>
<p class="abouttxt">Animals are our passion, and we believe that all who come
    through our shelter deserve to find their forever home. Through
    our sponsor program, people like you can help lessen the costs
    of adoption and contribute to the shelter by sponsoring one of 
    our lovely residents. This not only reduces their adoption fee
    (or waives it entirely), but it increases the chance of our friend
    being adopted to their forever home. This way, even those who
    aren't ready to take on a pet can still help our cause!</p>
